# Data Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository contains two data analysis projects performed using MS SQL:

1. **COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis**: An in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 data, focusing on infection rates, mortality rates, and the impact of vaccination.
2. **Nashville Housing Data Cleaning**: A project aimed at cleaning and transforming Nashville housing data to improve data quality and readiness for analysis.

## 1. COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis

### Purpose
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data to uncover trends and insights regarding infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination coverage. The analysis aimed to provide a clearer understanding of the pandemic's impact across different regions.

### Key Contributions
- **Metrics Calculation**: Analyzed metrics such as mortality rates and infection percentages.
- **Impact Analysis**: Investigated the effect of vaccination on case and death rates.
- **Trend Identification**: Identified regions with the highest infection and mortality rates.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilized advanced SQL techniques including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables.
- **Visualization**: Created SQL views to facilitate data visualization.

## 2. Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

### Purpose
Focused on cleaning and transforming the Nashville housing dataset to ensure its quality and suitability for further analysis. This project aimed to address inconsistencies, standardize values, and prepare the data for subsequent analysis.

### Key Contributions
- **Index Creation**: Enhanced query performance through indexing.
- **Date Standardization**: Reformatted date fields and handled missing data.
- **Address Parsing**: Split and standardized address components.
- **Data Standardization**: Addressed data inconsistencies and standardized values.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- **Column Cleanup**: Dropped unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.

## Repository

## Installation

To work with the SQL scripts, ensure you have:
1. An SQL Server environment (e.g., MS SQL Server or SQL Server Management Studio).
2. Access to [datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VYuZgnmkczMSgu6aAr6HjmmZXC4cI0DJ?usp=sharing) formatted similarly to those described in the projects.

## Usage

1. Load the SQL scripts into your SQL Server environment.
2. Load these datasets
3. Execute the scripts for each project to perform the analysis or data cleaning tasks.
4. Review the results to gain insights or verify data quality.
